# Notice ❗️

Neodymium has changed, and its new version uses the full power of [Vuejs](vuejs.org) and its ecosystem of libraries and plugins. Go **[here](https://github.com/soixantecircuits/nd)** to check it out.

## Install

```
$ npm install --global generator-neodymium
```

*Depending on your configuration, you ~~may~~ will encounter formatting issue right after the app generation. This is because `ejs`, the template engine yeoman uses, leaves empty lines in place of the omitted parts (e.g if you said you don't need a back-end, the back-end portion of your app README will be blank lines instead of not being here at all). This can lead to errors with the `package.json` file being invalid because of misplaced commas, etc. I'm currently looking for a solution to this using the yeoman transform streams, but until I figure this out in a clean and maintenable way, you'll have to deal with this by your own :/*

## Usage

With [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo):

```
$ yo neodymium
```

## Develop

It's recommended to use node `v4.2.4` LTS. We cannot guarantee previous versions support, but will sure do our best to. Please post an issue if you encounter troubles with developing on `neodymium`.

```
# Clone the repo and `cd` into it
$ git clone git@github.com:soixantecircuits/neodymium.git && cd neodymium
# Install the generator dependencies
$ npm i
# Now, create a symlink in your global `node_modules` folder.
# (If you have previously installed neodymium via the npm package, you should run `npm remove --global generator-neodymium` before this command)
$ npm link
```

The `yo neodymium` command will now execute your local version of neodymium. Enjoy :)
